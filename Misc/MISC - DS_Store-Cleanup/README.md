# DS_Store-Cleanup
This will scan an entire drive or path that you specify for ".DS_Store" files that are auto-created by MAC computers, and sometimes left in every directory on a drive.

This script will perform a "Dry-Run" so you can verify all of the files it will delete BEFORE it does anything. After you have confirmed the dry-run is OK, you can confirm by hitting "Y" to proceed on the confirmation screen.
