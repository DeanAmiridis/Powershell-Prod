# Powershell
This checks to see if the registry key "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Piriform\Agomo" exists. If it returns a True value, it will identify your system as infected. Otherwise, it will specify you are clean.
Please note this does *NOT* remove the registry key. This only does a check so you can take further action if needed.
