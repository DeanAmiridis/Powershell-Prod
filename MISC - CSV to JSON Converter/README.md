# Usage
I have removed the options/variables to negate the need to modify the script every time you would like to convert a csv to json. I have updated the script to use commandlets to make things simple. Please see the example below on the usage:

    .\win-csvtojson.ps1 -SourceFile "c:\path\source.csv" -DestinationFile "c:\path\destination.json"
